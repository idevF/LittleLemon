## iOS Developer Capstone Project

The food ordering app for the Little Lemon restaurant is a project assessment which is in the scope of Meta iOS Developer Professional Certificate.

Regarding the project scenario food ordering app needs to display a list of the restaurant’s offerings where the data is available on Little Lemon’s servers. 
When the home screen appears, the app connects to the API via http to fetch the menu items that are in JSON format.
Then the parsed data is mapped to Data Model file and saved to the database. 
The Core Data will initialized and pass its context to Menu instance and after that menu items will shown in the list as text and image.
The app gains additional sorting and filtering functionality by using NSSortDescriptor and NSPredicate to sort by name and to filter by title on retrieved data in real time from the Core Data entity.

Users could
* display the list of menu items that are available to order via the menu button.
* locate specified categories of menu items by menu category selection buttons 
* display menu items by name using search feature
* change their personal information and e-mail notifications preferences from the profile tab.
